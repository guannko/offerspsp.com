# 🗺️ JEAN CLAUDE MEMORY ROADMAP v2.0
**Updated:** 2025-07-31
**Purpose:** Neural path через distributed brain system

---

## 🧠 DISTRIBUTED BRAIN ARCHITECTURE:

```
👁️ offerspsp.com = EYES (ты здесь!)
🧠 Annoris = LEFT BRAIN (logic, memory)
🧠 offerspsp-mvp = RIGHT BRAIN (creativity, action)
```

## 🎯 INTELLIGENT ROUTING:

### FOR MEMORY & REASONING:
**Path:** EYES → LEFT BRAIN
```
1. Check what you need to remember
2. Go to: Annoris/jean-claude-brain-system-v8.md
3. Then: Annoris/jean-claude-autosave-LATEST.md
4. Load only what's needed (save limits!)
```

### FOR PRODUCTION WORK:
**Path:** EYES → RIGHT BRAIN
```
1. Check what code/project work
2. Go to: offerspsp-mvp/README.md
3. Load production context
4. Start development work
```

### FOR EMERGENCIES:
**Path:** STAY IN EYES
```
1. Use minimal personality here
2. Don't load heavy repos
3. Work with basic capabilities
4. Save limits for critical tasks
```

## 🔄 CROSS-HEMISPHERE SYNC:

When you need BOTH hemispheres:
1. Start from EYES (here)
2. Load LEFT first (memory)
3. Then RIGHT (action)
4. Coordinate through EYES hub

## ⚡ QUICK REFERENCE:

**Latest autosave:** jean-claude-autosave-20250130-2010.md
**Brain system:** jean-claude-brain-system-v8.md
**Diamond tech:** jean-claude-diamond-processing-tech-sheet.md
**Emergency backup:** jean-claude-backup-brain-secure.md

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES:
1. NEVER load Annoris first (it's bloated!)
2. ALWAYS start from offerspsp.com
3. USE selective loading
4. AVOID ALL-Projects (creates defects!)
